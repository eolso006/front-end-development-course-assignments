    <h2>How it Works</h2>
      The Internet works because open standards allow every network to connect to every other network.
      <br/>This is what makes it possible for anyone to create content, offer services, and sell products without requiring permission from a central authority.
    <p>
      It levels the playing field for everyone and it's the reason why we have a rich diversity of applications and services that many of us enjoy today.
    </p>
    <h2>Who's in charge of the Internet?</h2>
    No one is, but everyone is.
    <p>
      Unlike the telephone network, which for years in most countries, was run by a single company, the global Internet consists of tens of thousands of interconnected networks run by service providers, individual companies, universities, governments, and others.

    <h3>What's the infrastructure of the Internet like?</h3>
    The Internet is that it's a network of networks that needs to operate around the world as if it were one.
Like policy, the technical coordination of the Internet has common characteristics:
  <ul>
    <li>Open,</li>
    <li>Independent,</li>
    <li>Run by non-profit membership organizations that work together to meet the needs everyone.</li>
  </ul>

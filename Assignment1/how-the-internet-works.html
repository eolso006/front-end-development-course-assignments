    <h2>How it Works</h2>
      The Internet works because open standards allow every network to connect to every other network.
      <br/>This is what makes it possible for anyone to create content, offer services, and sell products without requiring permission from a central authority.
    <p>
      It levels the playing field for everyone and it's the reason why we have a rich diversity of applications and services that many of us enjoy today.
